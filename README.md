# Usage

## LDWPSO CNN

If you use MNIST dataset, you can use the following command.

```
python src/pso_mnist.py
```

If you use CIFAR-10 dataset, you can use the following command.

```
python src/pso_cifar10.py
```

## Validation

The output parameters can be verified by rewriting the following program.

- src/pso_mnist_result.py
- src/pso_cifar10_result.py

## Use data

- MNIST
- CIFAR-10
