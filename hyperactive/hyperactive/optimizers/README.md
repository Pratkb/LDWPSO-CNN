# Optimization Techniques

Hyperactive offers a wide variety of basic, meta-heuristic and sequential model-based optimization techniques for machine learning model selection and hyperparameter tuning. This readme provides an overview[*](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/tree/master/hyperactive/optimizers#disclaimer) and brief explainations of those techniques and proposes a possible field of application.

## Local Search:

#### [Hill Climbing](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/local/hill_climbing_optimizer.py)
Hill climbing is a very basic optimization technique, that explores the search space only localy. It starts at an initial point, which is often chosen randomly and continues to move to positions with a better solution. It has no method against getting stuck in local optima.

###### Use case/properties:
- Never as a first method of optimization
- When you have a very good initial point to start from
- If the search space is very simple and has few local optima or saddle points

#### [Stochastic Hill Climbing](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/local/stochastic_hill_climbing.py)
Stochastic hill climbing extends the normal hill climbing by a simple method against getting stuck in local optima. It has a parameter you can set, that determines the probability to accept worse solutions as a next position.

###### Use case/properties:
- Never as a first method of optimization
- When you have a very good initial point to start from

#### [Tabu Search](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/local/tabu_search.py)
Tabu search is a metaheuristic method, that explores new positions like hill climbing but memorizes previous positions and avoids those. This helps finding new trajectories through the search space.

###### Use case/properties:
- When you have a good initial point to start from

## Random Methods:

#### [Random Search](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/random/random_search.py)
The random search explores by choosing a new position at random after each iteration. Some random seach implementations choose a new position within a large hypersphere around the current position. The implementation in hyperactive is purely random across the search space in each step.

###### Use case/properties:
- Very good as a first method of optimization or to start exploring the search space
- For a short optimization run to get an acceptable solution

#### [Random Restart Hill Climbing](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/random/random_restart_hill_climbing.py)
Random restart hill climbing works by starting a hill climbing search and jumping to a random new position after a number of iterations.

###### Use case/properties:
- Good as a first method of optimization
- For a short optimization run to get an acceptable solution

#### [Random Annealing](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/random/random_annealing.py)
An algorithm that chooses a new position within a large hypersphere around the current position. This hypersphere gets smaller over time.

###### Use case/properties:
- Disclaimer: I have not seen this algorithm before, but invented it myself. It seems to be a good alternative to the other random algorithms
- Good as a first method of optimization
- For a short optimization run to get an acceptable solution

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo:

#### [Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/monte_carlo/simulated_annealing.py)
Simulated annealing chooses its next possible position similar to hill climbing, but it accepts worse results with a probability that decreases with time:

<p align="center">
  <a href="equation">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%20%3D%20exp%20%5Cleft%20%28%20-%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f_%7Bnorm%7D%7D%7BT%7D%20%5Cright%20%29">
  </a>
</p>

It simulates a temperature that decreases with each iteration, similar to a material cooling down. The following normalization is used to calculate the probability independent of the metric:

  </a>
</p>

###### Use case/properties:
- When you have a good initial point to start from, but expect the surrounding search space to be very complex
- Good as a second method of optimization


#### [Stochastic Tunneling](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/monte_carlo/stochastic_tunneling.py)
Stochastic Tunneling works very similar to simulated annealing, but modifies its probability to accept worse solutions by an additional term:

<p align="center">
  <a href="equation">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_%7BSTUN%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20exp%28-%5Cgamma%20%5CDelta%20f%29">
  </a>
</p>

This new acceptance factor is used instead of the delta f in the original equation:

  </a>
</p>



###### Use case/properties:
- When you have a good initial point to start from, but expect the surrounding search space to be very complex
- Good as a second method of optimization

#### [Parallel Tempering](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/monte_carlo/parallel_tempering.py)
Parallel Tempering initializes multiple simulated annealing seaches with different temperatures and chooses to swap those temperatures with the following probability:

<p align="center">
  <a href="equation">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%20%3D%20%5Cmin%20%5Cleft%20%28%201%2C%20e%5E%7B%5CDelta%20f%20%5Cleft%20%28%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BT_x%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BT_y%7D%20%5Cright%20%29%7D%20%5Cright%20%29">
  </a>
</p>


###### Use case/properties:
- Not as dependend of a good initial position as simulated annealing
- If you have enough time for many model evaluations


<br>

## Population Methods:

#### [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/population/particle_swarm_optimization.py)
Particle swarm optimization works by initializing a number of positions at the same time and moving all of those closer to the best one after each iteration. 

###### Use case/properties:
- If the search space is complex and large
- If you have enough time for many model evaluations

#### [Evolution Strategy](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/population/evolution_strategy.py)
Evolution strategy mutates and combines the best individuals of a population across a number of generations without transforming them into an array of bits (like genetic algorithms) but uses the real values of the positions. 

###### Use case/properties:
- If the search space is very complex and large
- If you have enough time for many model evaluations


<br>

## Sequential Methods:

#### [Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/SimonBlanke/Hyperactive/blob/master/hyperactive/optimizers/sequence_model/bayesian_optimization.py)
Bayesian optimization chooses new positions by calculating the expected improvement of every position in the search space based on a gaussian process that trains on already evaluated solutions.

###### Use case/properties:
- If model evaluations take a long time
- If you do not want to do many iterations
- If your search space is not to big
